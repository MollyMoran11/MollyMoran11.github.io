 <p>Welcome to the classroom math website.</p>
<p> The objective of this website is that students will be able to reteach their 
math concepts on multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition. Students will 
be able to individually access the website both in the classroom and at home in 
order to have guidance when doing their work. The goal is to begin mastering these
skills to use throughout the year as we build our math knowledge. By mastering these 
skills, you will be able to apply it in other areas we discuss such as measurement 
and fractions as well. We can keep track of our growth in each of the core math areas 
and build on our current knowledge. This website can be accessed at any time in 
order to go back and remind ourselves of the different steps and strategies that 
can be used when solving problems. By the end of the year, our goal is to have 
mastered these four points before moving on to the next grade level.</p>
