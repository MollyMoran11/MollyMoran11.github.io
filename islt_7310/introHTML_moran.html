    My name is Molly Moran from St. Charles, Missouri. I have lived in Missouri my whole life. I grew up with my parents and brother. In 2013, I graduated from Francis Howell Central High School. Growing up, I loved to travel and read in my free time. When I was younger I knew that I loved getting to help and support others. This made me want to become a teacher. I have a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Missouri. In 2017, I graduated and started working in education. I am currently a third grade teacher. This will be my fourth year teaching. I have taught both second and third grade. I started my master’s program to better my understanding of technology. The skills I learn through this program will help me in the classroom. I hope to make learning interactive for my students. This can help engage their understanding.
