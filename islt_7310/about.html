                    <h3><em>Third Grade Educator</em></h3>
<p>My name is Molly Moran and I am in my fourth year teaching in the Hazelwood School 
District. In 2017, I graduated from the <em>University of Missouri</em> with my Bachelorâ€™s 
Degree in Elementary Education. This has helped me to be certified to teach grades 
1-6th. Before beginning in my own classroom, I was a teaching assistant in the Parkway 
School District, which helped me start developing my own skills. The following year I 
began in the Hazelwood School District and have continued expanding on my teaching 
practices and strengthening my abilities. I have taught in both second and third grade 
classrooms so far. I have currently begun my Master&rsquo;s Program in order to further my 
education and skills to be applied in the classroom.<br/>I love being able to teach my 
students their different skills including technology skills in order to use them as 
they continue with their education in the <strong>future.</strong></p>
